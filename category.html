        <h3 class="editor-picks-item-title">The best robot vacuums for 2023</h3>
        <p class="author">Written By Alpha July 12, 2023</p>
        <p class="BRV-text">Robot vacuums have come a long way over the past few years. They're smarter,
            more powerful and (marginally) better at avoiding chair legs during a cleaning session than they ever were
            before, and some of them even have built-in mopping functionality and a penchant for pet hair. Plus, you
            don't have to shell out as much money to get one either. It's safe to say the space is pretty saturated now,
            with established names like iRobot and Shark competing with companies like Anker and TP-Link that are not
            necessarily known for their dirt-sucking tech. With all those choices, deciding which is going to be the
            best buy isn't as simple as it was a few years ago. We tested out many of the newest models available now to
            see how they stack up against each other and to help you choose the best robot vacuums for your needs. Here
            are our top picks.
